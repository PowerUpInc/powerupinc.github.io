{"name":"PowerUp API Documentation","tagline":"V1, Codename: \"Squirrel\"","body":"# PowerUp API V1\r\n## Codename \"Squirrel\"\r\n[PowerUp](https://powerup.io) is a personal analytics tool that turns your achievements and goals into stories. The PowerUp API, documented here, allows you to slice and dice your PowerUp data, and find correlations within. Over time, we'll release tools to help you do this, using this API.\r\n\r\n#**This API is not yet stable, and this is only a preview. Please don't use it until this warning is removed. Stay tuned!**\r\n\r\n# Basic Concepts\r\nPowerUp revolves around a few really basic concepts for representing goals and achievements, Grids, and PowerUps.\r\n\r\n## Grids\r\nGrids represent a goal you'd like to achieve. This grid can contain a description, one or many users collaborating together, and PowerUps that represent steps toward the overall goal.\r\n\r\n### Data Structure\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": String,\r\n      \"name\": String,\r\n      \"about\": String,\r\n      \"data_types\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"data_type\": String,\r\n          \"name\": String\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"grid_buttons\": [ String ],\r\n      \"user\": User,\r\n      \"is_private\": Boolean,\r\n      \"collaborators\": [ User ],\r\n      \"powerUps\": [ PowerUp ],\r\n      \"slug\": String,\r\n      \"size\": Number\r\n    }      \r\n\r\n## PowerUps\r\nPowerUps represent individual achievements, steps toward a bigger goal, for example, running 1 mile. These PowerUps contain metadata, which can include any arbitrary stats or info you like. Grids typically include 3 different PowerUp types, which represent different achievements.\r\n\r\n### Work-in-progress, sorry!
